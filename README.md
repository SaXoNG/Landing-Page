How to Run the Project
You can run the MyBike website locally in just a few steps:
1. Clone the Repository
If you haven't already, clone the project to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mybike.git
cd mybike
Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username if applicable.
2. Open the Project
Since this is a static website built with HTML, CSS (SCSS compiled), and vanilla JavaScript, you don’t need any special backend or build tools.
You can simply open the main HTML file in your browser:
open index.html
Or right-click index.html in your file explorer and choose "Open With" → your browser.
3. Optional: Use a Local Development Server
To simulate a production-like environment and avoid issues with relative paths, you can use a local dev server (recommended for testing forms and responsiveness).
Option 1: VS Code Live Server Extension
If you're using Visual Studio Code:
Install the Live Server extension.
Open the project folder in VS Code.
Right-click index.html and choose "Open with Live Server".
Option 2: Using Python HTTP Server
If you have Python installed:
Python 3.x
python -m http.server
Then open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000
